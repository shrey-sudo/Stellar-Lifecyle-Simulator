Stellar Lifecycle Simulator
 
# Stellar Lifecycle Simulator

This project simulates the life cycle of stars based on their initial mass. It covers key stages from stellar birth in nebulae to their final fate as white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes.

#Features

- **Dynamic Stellar Evolution**: Simulates the lifecycle of stars based on their mass:
- **Low-Mass Stars (< 8 Solar Masses)**: Ends as a White Dwarf.
- **Medium-Mass Stars (8–20 Solar Masses)**: Ends as a Neutron Star.
- **High-Mass Stars (> 20 Solar Masses)**: Ends as a Black Hole.
- **Supernova Explosion**: Visualizes a supernova explosion with particle effects.
- **Accretion Disk**: Displays an accretion disk around black holes.
- **Interactive Controls**: Use the `SPACE` key to progress through the stages of the star's lifecycle.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pygame` library
- `tkinter` (comes pre-installed with Python)

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Install the required library using pip:
